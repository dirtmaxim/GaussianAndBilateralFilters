##### Implementation of Bilateral filter, Gaussian filter and its derivatives by X and Y. It was written for educational purposes, so it can help you to understand how to process images with these kind of filters.

This application provides GUI written in JavaFX, thus you can easily try each filter. You are able to set different sigma values and watch to image changes.
